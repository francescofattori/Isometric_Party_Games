# Isometric Party Games
This is a long term project of an isometric engine based on Pixi.js and Geckos.io / Socket.io for multiplayer. This engine should allow to add multiple minigames made by you for enjoying a party night with your friends.
One main feature is that it works also offline as a static webpage so that it can be hosted for free on github pages and even installed as a webapp.
